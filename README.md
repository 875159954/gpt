This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisite

First, make sure Node version is 18.x, run:
    
    node -v

I get result of v18.15.0, I've tested that 16.x doesn't work.

## Get Started

run npm i and wait for modules to install.

    npm i
then run npm run to start the dev server.
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



## Deploy

I failed to build a docker image to serve this app. If you can accomplish that, hope you can give me a hand.
